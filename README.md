## üöÄ About The Project

This project harnesses the creativity and technical skills of students to develop a satellite-themed MP3 player. Designed to simulate the control panel of a satellite, it plays music while providing a stellar user interface that mimics navigating through space.

### Key Features

- **Orbital Interface**: Experience music through an interface that looks like you're controlling a satellite.
- **Space Sounds**: Integrates sounds from space missions for an immersive experience.
- **Celestial Design**: A slick, futuristic design that matches the theme of space exploration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - For crafting the user interface.
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) - Giving the desktop app a native feel.
